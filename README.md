# Ascra - Achievement Hub

Ascra is a **private**, personal web application to track and achieve your goals. You can create, view, and delete goals with an easy-to-use interface. This web app was created to help me (and others) stay on track and motivated with your goals.

## Features

- **Create Goals**: Add goals with titles, types, and deadlines.
- **View Goals**: See your created goals listed on the main page.
- **Delete Goals**: Delete a goal with confirmation to prevent accidental deletions.
- **Achievements**: Earn and unlock achievements as you go!
- 
### Privacy

I am so commited to user privacy I have used localStorage to help create this app! localStorage makes it so your data is saved locally on your browser/device and **NEVER** leaves your device

## Usage

### Creating a Goal

1. Go to the homepage of the app.
2. Fill in the goal's title (e.g., "Do the dishes"), select a goal type, and optionally set a deadline.
3. Click on **Create Goal** to add the goal to your list.

### Viewing Goals

- Once you create a goal, it will appear in the **Your Goals** section.
- Goals are displayed with their title, type (e.g., Short-Term, Medium-Term, Long-Term), and due date.

### Deleting a Goal

1. To delete a goal, click the **Delete** button next to the goal.
2. A confirmation prompt will appear asking you to confirm the deletion.
3. If confirmed, the goal will be deleted from your list and from local storage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and minimal interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for goal creation, storage (using localStorage), and deletion.
